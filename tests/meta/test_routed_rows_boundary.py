"""The rows a MoE dispatch routes onto a rank are eval's fact, stated once.

`eval.routed.RoutedLaunch` (`Analysis.routed`) is the one statement of a
rank's dispatch boundary — the tokens it holds, the rows routed onto its
experts, its experts, the padded launch — and `layout` produces the
per-rank evidence it is read from (`ExpectedRoutedLoad`). Everything
downstream (`inference`, `kernel_bench`, `rendering`, `api`, `service`,
`tools`) reads the record; none of it may derive the routed rows again.
The 2026-10-25 audit found six such derivations, each disagreeing with the
others somewhere.

What this gate refuses, by AST, outside `backend/arch/eval` and
`backend/arch/layout`:

  * arithmetic that combines the routing counts `n_experts_active` and
    `n_route_targets` — the per-expert mean `M = B·s·k·g/e` restated
    (`Evaluator._tokens_per_expert` is its one statement);
  * reading the routed-load evidence's row readings
    (`expected_rows_per_expert`, `expected_rows_on_rank`,
    `routed_row_capacity_per_rank`, `busiest_rank_load_factor`) — the
    per-rank rows `RoutedLaunch` already carries.

It is deliberately not a ban on the names: `n_experts_active` is a cell
axis of the router's own kernels (`moe_topk_softmax`, `moe_gate`), which
read it as the top-k width and derive no rows from it. A name ban would
refuse those and be argued down; this refuses only the derivation.
