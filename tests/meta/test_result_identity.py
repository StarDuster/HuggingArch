"""One answer to "what identifies an estimate's result"
(`backend/measure/scope.py`, docs/measured_calibration.md §7.5):
every cache of an estimate's result takes its key and its remote
eligibility from it. This gate enumerates the places a cache key is built
under `backend/api` and `backend/service`: `make_key` is called only by the
identity module and by caches whose value is not an estimate's result (each
named with what it holds), and a call's arguments are pickled only by
`offload.call_key`, where an estimate request stands for its identity."""
