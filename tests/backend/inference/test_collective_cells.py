"""A collective is a kernel somebody has to measure, and its cell is the row's.

Nothing bound the collectives layout grafts, so `all_reduce`, `all_gather`,
`all_to_all`, `reduce_scatter` and the pipeline's `send_recv` only ever
reached the plan's dropped list: communication time had never been
calibrated on any multi-GPU deployment, and because a measured total is
all-or-nothing over a step's ops, one unmeasured collective denied every
multi-GPU layout a measured line at all.

What is pinned here: that every op the registry CALLS a collective is
measurable (so a sixth primitive cannot be added without a cell), that the
cell is read off the facts the walk published about the launch rather than
rebuilt from a deployment label, that a row re-read at another batch has no
cell rather than the walked batch's, and that the one collective which was
already measured — the fused all-reduce+RMSNorm — is untouched.
