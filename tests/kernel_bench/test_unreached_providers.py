"""A kernel that no corpus cell reaches says so, where the claim is made.

A provider's `serves` is a promise: the coverage audit counts a cell as
served when some provider claims it, and the API publishes the claim. Three
different facts can leave a registered kernel with no rows, and they want
opposite actions — it must not be measured (`disabled_reason`), the card is
wrong for it (`min_sm`), or it is right and nothing in this corpus asks for
it. Only the first two were declarable, so the third read as "no rows, no
reason declared", which is also how a declaration BUG reads. Nine kernels
sat in that bucket: marlin's weight-only FP8 against a corpus whose FP8
models quantise the activation too, and the fp16/fp32 twins of three
launches every corpus model ships in bf16.

What is tested here is the pair, not the sentence: a kernel that declares
the reason must also still REFUSE the cells the corpus has (otherwise the
reason is stale and the kernel was reachable all along), and a kernel that
declares none must not be one of the known-honest ones. The corpus facts
each reason names are asserted against cells built here, so a declaration
quietly widened to grab the corpus's cells — the "gate wider than the
build" failure the closed declaration exists to prevent — turns this red.
