"""Which driver ran a row, read from the machine and stamped on the row.

A box can measure one env through NVIDIA's forward-compatibility user-mode
driver and another through its own — `kernel_bench/envs/boxes/
h100-sxm-cu128.toml` does exactly that, for three envs and deliberately not
the rest — and before schema 14 nothing on a row said which. These cover the
two reads (`/proc/driver/nvidia/version` for the box's kernel-mode driver,
`/proc/self/maps` for the user-mode driver this process actually loaded) and
the stamping that puts both on the row.

The reads are tested against TEXT rather than the running machine, because
what has to be right is the parsing of forms this box does not have: the
packaged driver's `575.57.08` beside the open module's `595.84`, and a
`libcuda` that came out of a compat directory.
