"""The measuring loop a box serves: one model at a time, oldest first.

A box with a plan for a model measures it, writes a `.done` beside the
results, and takes the next plan. That is the whole loop, and it ran for
three days as a shell script on one machine's local disk — a disk a node
reallocation wipes, taking the only copy of how this box measures with it.

Two things in it are not obvious and are the reason it is code:

CROSS-MODEL DEDUP
    Every run is given every OTHER model's results as `--measured-in`.
    The physical key carries no model name, so a cell another model
    already measured is this model's cell: skipping it is correct, and
    not skipping it is hours of GPU time spent re-measuring the same
    geometry under a different model's name. The operator's own
    `--measured-in` (an export of what the corpus already holds) is
    merged in the same way.

STOPPING
    The loop runs `run-all` as a child and waits. SIGTERM stops both,
    without the process-group kill the shell version needed — which took
    the loop down along with the run every time, so a restart was two
    commands and a guess about which of them had actually died.
