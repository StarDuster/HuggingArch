"""Where a run's generation record is kept.

A generation record is ONE per (owner, model): the spec bundle a run
produced, the snapshot it was judged against, where it stands
(`GenerationStatus`), and the id that review, fix and PR are pointed at.
Every later step of the pipeline is keyed on one, so a run that leaves none
leaves those steps nothing to act on.

Two deployments keep that same record in two places:

    Supabase    `backend.service.spec_generations` — the hosted,
                multi-user tier: the conditional write RPCs, one row per
                (user, model) plus at most one pending row beside it.
    host-local  one JSON file per (owner, model) under
                `~/.huggingarch/spec_records/<owner>/<model>/record.json`,
                for a deployment with no database — a self-host, or a
                local offline run.

This module is the only place that chooses, so every caller asks one
question ("the record of this (owner, model)") and the deployment decides
who answers. The two are backends of one record, not two notions of one:
the field names, the status vocabulary (`backend.spec_worker.outcome`) and
the outcome words (`RecordOutcome`) are the ones the RPCs already use, and
the local write keeps the same rule `record_generation` keeps — the working
candidate is overwritten in place.

Why the chooser lives here and not inside `spec_generations`: `backend.service`
is an OPTIONAL package (a no-service build drops it, see
tests/meta/test_service_layout.py) and core may import it only lazily, under
a `supabase_env.configured()` guard. A chooser inside `spec_generations`
would be unreachable in exactly the deployment that needs the local backend.
This is the arrangement `shared_spec_miss` already uses for the shared spec
cache, whose service-side module says so in as many words.

The local owner is the reserved `__anonymous__` overlay owner
(`overlay.run_overlay_owner`) — the name this repo already gives "the single
user of a deployment with no auth". There is no second identity.
