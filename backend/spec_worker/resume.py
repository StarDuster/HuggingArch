"""Continue an earlier generation from the draft its leaf kept.

A generate run that does not succeed (out of time, out of repair rounds, or
cut off by a restart) leaves its draft — any YAML it authored — in its
generate leaf. A continued generation re-opens that leaf
(`overlay.resume_run_overlay`), takes a fresh overall budget, and hands the
agent the draft with the validator's current verdict on it:

  * when the leaf's last run recorded a session (`RunEnd`) for the same
    agent CLI, that session can take another turn (its agent did not fill
    the context window) and the CLI can re-enter it, the first round
    RESUMES the session with the continuation as its next turn;
  * otherwise the agent cold-starts on the original task prompt followed by
    the continuation.

The run is judged like a refine: an untouched draft is judged as it stands
(`seeded_spec`), not as "nothing generated".
