"""Where the Supabase credentials are read, and what "configured" means.

Nine modules read `SUPABASE_URL` and seven read the service-role key, each
answering "is this deployment wired to Supabase?" for itself. They agreed —
but each spelled the answer its own way (`get(...)` vs `get(..., "")`, some
stripping the trailing slash, some not), so a URL written with a trailing
slash produced a double slash from half of them, and a deployment that set
the URL without a key looked configured to the modules that only checked the
URL.

It sits at the top of `backend` rather than inside `backend.service`
because importing anything from that package runs its `__init__`, which
registers HTTP routes against the shared app — so a spec worker asking
"is Supabase configured?" would drag the whole service layer into its
import graph, and `backend.api._app` into a cycle with itself. Reading two
environment variables needs none of that.

The environment is still read on every call, not captured at import: tests
set these with `monkeypatch.setenv` around individual cases, and a value
frozen at import would ignore them.
