"""`python -m backend.inference.validate <model_id>` — validate for publication.

The arch validator (`backend.arch.validate`) plus its last gate, the replay
of the analysis on the product's deployments (`analysable.replay_gate`).
`valid: true` from this entry point means the spec matches its checkpoint and
analyses on every deployment the product offers for it. Same arguments and
JSON as the arch CLI, which stays as the arch-only diagnostic.
