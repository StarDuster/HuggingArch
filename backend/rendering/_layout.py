"""Layer-layout pass for the architecture-view's `assignments:` cards.

Folds a heterogeneous `assignments:` stack into UI cards that reflect the
actual layer-index order: contiguous runs of one block kind collapse into
single cards, periodic interleavings (hybrid attention) collapse into a
single "cycle container" with per-position inner cards.

A card is one block KIND (`BlockMeta.family_name`, `CSA + MoE FFN`), not
one template: the templates of a kind that differ only in a component they
bind (DeepSeek-V4.1's KV-owning and KV-borrowing CSA layers) are its
`variants`, each with its own layers and its own expandable block. Cutting
a card at every template change would split the stack wherever a layer
owns some state the next ones reuse.

Pure layout — the per-index map is the stack's block invocations
(`BlockMeta.layer_indices`), plus the `block_label_fn` callback the
architecture view supplies. No spec / engine modification, no rendering /
styling.

    order, collapsing periodic interleavings into a single cycle card.

    `metas` are the stack's block invocations (`BlockMeta`s whose
    `layer_path` is the stack's).

    Pipeline:
    1. Build a per-layer-index map of each layer's block kind
       (`family_name`) and template from those invocations.
    2. Search the kind sequence for the longest contiguous range with a
       periodic pattern (period ≥ 2) — covers e.g. miaomiao's
       `(deltanet×3 + mla_moe)` cycle, Qwen3-Next's `(linear×3 + full)`
       cycle, GPT-OSS's `(SWA + GQA)` 2-period alternation. A kind
       carries attention and FFN together, so a dense prefix before an
       MoE steady state (Step-3.7-Flash) stays a prefix run.
    3. Emit cards: edge runs (single-kind stretches outside the cycle),
       one collapsed cycle card, edge runs after.
    4. Fallback: when no periodic span exists, emit one card per
       contiguous single-kind run.
