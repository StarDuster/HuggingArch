"""ProcessGroupFamily — a world resolved to explicit process-group members.

The layout algebra asks every group question by membership, never by name:
`alias_map`'s normalization is `same`, `contains` is `refines`, and the
partial-overlap case that today has no answer gets one (`overlaps`) that
lowering must either plan for or reject aloud. A family is a few hundred
integers per deployment — smaller than the model graph — and is built
once per deployment and cached by the caller.

Nothing here reads `REGION_AXES` or any mesh table: construction stays
where it lives today (the mesh resolver); this type only holds the result
and answers relations on it.
