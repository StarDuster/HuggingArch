"""Layer-0 spec walker — single source of truth.

Two primary APIs, both memoized per ResolvedSpec:

  • `iter_blocks(resolved) -> List[BlockMeta]`
        Block-template invocation metadata: which template each layer
        slot uses, how many copies, which stack it lives in, whether
        it's an aux group (mtp / vision / audio / speculative), and
        any assignment-level dim overrides.

  • `iter_leaves(resolved) -> List[LeafTensor]`
        One `LeafTensor` per weight-bearing leaf, with HF-folded
        `spec_id` (matches renderer ids), HF on-disk `tensor_name`,
        `shape`, `multiplicity`, `role`, `component_path`, `dim_symbols`.

Nothing here evaluates cost. It walks `spec.model` and the spec's
BlockGraphs directly. Rendering, materialize's test path, and the
inference layer (weight_breakdown / capacity) consume structure from
here.

Layout: `nodes` holds the IR data types, `build` constructs them
(`SpecTreeWalker` + `iter_tree`), `projections` answers questions off
the tree. Internal dim resolution goes through `eval.dim.eval_dim_expr`
— the same funnel the evaluator uses — so IR stays mode-agnostic even
though the current public APIs return numeric data only.
